# Lufa Farms weekly order canceler

Once upon a time, we were able to order grocery from Lufa Farms whenever and however we wanted.  
After recent development, they have switched the process to become a subscription model and are forcing us customers to order consistently every week.  
This script cancels all regular weekly orders.

## Why even do this?

Because you can always use the `Extra Basket` feature to get grocery delivered as quick as Amazon Prime 1-day shipping anyway!

## How to run this:

1. Fork this repo
2. Configure the `LUFA_CANCELER_CONFIG` repository secret in your fork, according to the config.json.template file. (Fill in the blanks)
3. Enable github workflows.
